## Packages and settings

First we load the packages necessary to knit this document.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = TRUE,
    warning = FALSE,
    fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

The study data for each participant is included in a separate file which
include the subject ID and arm. We want to create a tidy dataframe with
data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and
observations over time.

First, we want a dataframe with all file names. After, we map the
`read_csv` function over each path name, which creates a list column.
Lastly, we use `unnest` to expand the list column.

``` r
full_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/data/"),
    path = str_c("data/data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

Now we need to tidy the result. And file names to include control arm
and subject ID. Tidy weekly observations and perform other tidying as
needed.

``` r
tidy_df = 
  full_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_"
  ) %>% 
  select(group, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

Lastly, we will make a spaghetti plot for observations on each subject
over time.

``` r
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, colour = group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  facet_grid(~group)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_yc4017_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Comparing the two groups, we see that the average outcome is much lower
in the control group than the experimental group. In addition, while
outcome for the control group remained fairly constant, the outcome for
the experimental group increased steadily from week 1 to week 8.
